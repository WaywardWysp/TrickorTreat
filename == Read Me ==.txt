		Oh, where to begin... I have discovered the rush of building a game in one day because
	I was flying to close to the sun when coding and managed to corrupt the game. I had not 
	uploaded anything to GitHub or an external platform so rest in peace that version.
	To be fair I took it as a sign to take a break and starting from scratch actually worked
	better for an odd reason, so it was stressful but I made it through... sort of.
	
		Some implements of my game are for a possibility of continuation in the future.
	I think this could make a cute spooky rougelike game for a game jam possibly. Granted,
	not much of a game jam when most of what I have is sort of already planned out.
		Redardless the coding obviously took some struggles, and because of this I did not
	remake some of my art assets like I was hoping to, but the main walking animation is there.
	Audio and particles I have a pretty good understanding of so long as everything talks to one
	another properly in the scripts.
	
		I won't lie, still not super comfortable with coding. Especially after somehow destroying
	the program (QA testing might be a great future carreer path for me). However, I feel I can 
	handle most of the basics. New goals of mine include getting more comfortable with camera 
	switching or scene changes possibly. Most of what I did this time was what I already knew
	as I kind of cut my own time manegment in a sliver with a major project crash. 
	
	I feel like I ran a marathon... it's done though.
